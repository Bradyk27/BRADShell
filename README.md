For the record, the argument parsing system is abysmal. 

I would have VERY much liked to use function calls and come up with a more algorithmic and elegant solution than just a bunch of if-statements.

However.

Due to time, I opted to go this route because I had no idea how long piping, reads, redirects, etc. would take (conveniently hardly at all. Likely 90% of my time was simply argument parsing).

So, what I'm getting at is, I know it's terrible. I know there's a better way to do it. I intend on implementing it. So ignore that portion of my programming ability, kk thnx.
